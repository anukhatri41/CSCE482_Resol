Started with Serum SDK - a lot is deprecated for Solana

Must be owner to run on chain program on Solana?
- When you deploy a smart contract
- OWner on account level
- Function will take many accounts, so making sure the owner of account is owner of smart contract?

Raydium SDK
SOL<->USD
May be calling wrong function - find one not accessible only by owner, maybe general user
makeTradeTransaction
Documentation is ... bad
Raydium is not open-source, so harder to find the code necessary
Contact Raydium

Make arbitrage bot that gets price and does trading - may not have to be good trading rn

Maybe try Orca instead of Raydium or Mango

Focus on dev net first

mango-client-v3 - use as basis

Need to look at Serum again, anchor project - framework that lets you write smart contracts, so use for on chain program

Most transactions on Solana are through bots
