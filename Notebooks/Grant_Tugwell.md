Brainstormed names, did solana research.

Met with Dr. Huang and Laren, cleared up our confusion we had about how we should think about our project 
as well as the idea behind our implementation. Clarified what it means to work on the blockchain, as well as how we can begin to start our development.

Drew out our ideas, got a high level understanding of what we need to do, what we need to research for next class.
