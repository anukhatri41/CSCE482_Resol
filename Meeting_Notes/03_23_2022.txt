Meeting Notes - 03/23/2022

Trading Strategy
- Is a little random
- Is doing Orca then Jupiter
- Orca is right now OXY -> SOL
- Jupiter is SOL -> OXY

Move the transaction steps into 1 function that's on chain
Check after two steps if there's profit, if not, cancel both

How is Jupiter getting the info for the routes, and is it real-time?

Simulation vs. Real Transaction may have discrepancies, so can only be precise if we have our own on chain program for doing simulation to see profit and immediately sending real one

Write a logging functionality
Macro message in smart contract - msg something
- Refer to hello world program
Log message is stored on chain, and can go back to look at them

Get results from sending to smart contract on rpc
- Problem may arise when there a lot of transactions, harder to visualize

Priority
- Write atomic function on chain
- Send transaction to that, and see if can improve profit

Can get reimbursement for the expenses like the RPC node and the rent
Will also be more when deploying the smart contract because takes many transactions

Need infrastructure, get on chain, rollback if not profitable, then can optimize it 

Right now we're doing currency pairs, but could expand to do more beyond that
