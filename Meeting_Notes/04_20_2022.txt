04_20_2022 - Meeting Notes

10 Minutes Presentation/Demo + 5 minutes Q&A
Record 5 minute video of demo
Deadline - 9:30am Monday
Final Presentation - 2-4pm 

Refined the strategy
8/14 transactions successful - made $0.012
See what makes those 8 successful and what they have in common

Identify which slippage is unreliable
Fails when slippage exceeds than quoted, not because it's not profitable

Orca & Raydium are the 2 reliable exchanges where the transaction will follow through
Tried UXP, but didn't really work

Higher amounts are not necessarily equaling higher profits
Possibly take out the "too good to be true" check 

Tried multiple terminals at once, but because it's a public RPC node, it said too many requests and would time out
QuickNode - private RPC node

Pricing on public node
Transactions on private node

Successful Demo
- Give 1 minute transaction time and see if can do about 10 transactions
- Show monitoring and then open up solscan to show the transactions
- Make some charts of past data of the last week of transactions since harder to show during the demo since so short
- Talk about lessons learned
- What is the best idea of your trading strategy - show the key insights from what you learned in the process
- What is our advantage and what makes our arbitrage better than others - we got some atomicity going (before were losing a lot more)

Successful Project Meaning
- Non-stakeholders are impressed


Add information about the team on the website
Show metrics on website of how much made, etc.
