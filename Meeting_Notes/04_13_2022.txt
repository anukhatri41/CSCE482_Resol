Have identifies currency pairs that are good for swapping
Atomic - OXY -> RAY -> SOL

Look at historical data to identify profitable swaps - what time, currency pairs, etc.
Increase swap amounts - or increase risks in other ways

Look at statistical arbitrage - lose/profit, but overall profits
Kelly criteria - how to determine how much to put in per trade
 - If profitability event >50%, should be making the trade

UXP Token
- May have some good opportunities for swapping
- Is a stable-ish coin

Leaving open account and keeping the wrapped sol to then close later
