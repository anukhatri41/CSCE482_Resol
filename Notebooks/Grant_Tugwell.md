Brainstormed names, did solana research.


<h4>2/2/22</h4>

Met with Dr. Huang and Laren, cleared up our confusion we had about how we should think about our project 
as well as the idea behind our implementation. Clarified what it means to work on the blockchain, as well as how we can begin to start our development.

Drew out our ideas, got a high level understanding of what we need to do, what we need to research for next class.


<h4>2/7/22</h4>

Today we started working on our project proposal, looking at our weekly report we need to work on, and started to experiment with Solana.

We created a paper wallet, which we were able to modify the balance of, and check the balance from other computers.

When working on our project proposal, we started to think:
- What we would need in terms of hardware, hosting, etc?
- How we would deploy our code on the blockchain?
- What is the scope of our project?
- How are we going to handle hosting our monitoring software?

We had team bonding time as well after we firmed up some of the details about our project.
