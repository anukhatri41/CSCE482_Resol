Meeting - 2/2/2022
Finalizing Idea / Discussing more specifics 

Crypto Arbitrage
Maybe find some existing examples for the arbitrage and improve on it/go from there

Will be a program that executes on the Solana network, doesn't matter the currency

Offchain - decides the opportunity of selling
Onchain/Online - the platform to create transactions?

Search Solana Arbitrage projects
Search Google/GitHub - solana amm list (Serum, Mango, etc.)
Mango is likely open-source
How to create arbitrager on Solana


Market is a smart contract
Market maker - have formula to calculate price between tokens

Interaction with markets 
Usually is manual, but arbitrage is auto

Not between brokerages for this project

Deck = place to exchange crypto

Tech Stack - 
Arbitrager - Real-time monitoring of markets of < 1ms
- Python script for reading?
- Maybe C++ for speedier 
Send transactions to onchain program - do as single transaction for all buy/sell so the prices don't change in between transactions
Want atomic transactions - all or nothing - don't want to buy/sell but then lose


Single Transaction
- 1 = buy
- 2 = sell
- buy 1, see if still profit, if not give back and eat the fee, otherwise go through with 2nd transaction to finish
