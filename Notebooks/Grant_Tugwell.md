<h4>1/31/22</h4>

Brainstormed names, did solana research.


<h4>2/2/22</h4>

Met with Dr. Huang and Laren, cleared up our confusion we had about how we should think about our project 
as well as the idea behind our implementation. Clarified what it means to work on the blockchain, as well as how we can begin to start our development.

Drew out our ideas, got a high level understanding of what we need to do, what we need to research for next class.


<h4>2/7/22</h4>

Today we started working on our project proposal, looking at our weekly report we need to work on, and started to experiment with Solana.

We created a paper wallet, which we were able to modify the balance of, and check the balance from other computers.

When working on our project proposal, we started to think:
- What we would need in terms of hardware, hosting, etc?
- How we would deploy our code on the blockchain?
- What is the scope of our project?
- How are we going to handle hosting our monitoring software?

We had team bonding time as well after we firmed up some of the details about our project.

<h4>2/9/22</h4>

Today we met with the professor, discussed what our focus should be, and narrowed down what our first milestone should be.

We decided to have aim for 2/28/22 for our first milestone. Our first milestone consists of creating a basic version of our planned monitoring software.

Our plans for our monitoring software include:
- Multiple threads utilized to monitor currency pair pricing
- Use Raydium and Mango (both Solana AMM's) to monitor first
- Monitor SOL/USDC price

This is our minimal viable product, and we decided to aim to complete this by 2/28/22, that way we have a couple cushion days before we meet with Dr. Huang and Laren.

<h4>2/14/22</h4>

Today we gave our presentation.

Additionally, we did a lot of research and began experimenting with actually using Solana, so we can get an idea of what is happening.

I have a little bit of SOL in my coinbase account, so as a group, we moved the SOL into a chrome based wallet, and connected it
with one of the AMM's we are planning to use, Raydium. We did not make any purchases, but we moved the SOL between coinbase and the chrome wallet, connected the
wallet, and viewed things such as the how pricing flucuates, the speed of a SOL transaction, etc.

We also began exploring serum and anchor. We now understand, at least in theory, how we are supposed to go about interacting with the blockchain,
and have been looking over tutorials about how to send instructions in blockchain transactions. We also have been utilizing solscan to see the addresses that things like Raydium use to make transactions.
