Meeting Notes - 04/06/2022

There are consistent profits, if it fails the only loss is the transaction fee

Trading Strategy
Using Jupiter routes for SOL -> SOL
Slippage = 0.1 %
May be too fragile of a strategy and will not scale - probably will not be profitable

Keeping metadata in a JSON with each strategy separate
Called backtesting, use strategy on past data to see if it would work on new data

Seems there's more success at night

Sol -> Sol seems more successful than like Sol -> Oxy

Check account before/after, where delta is > 0, and that encompasses transaction fees, etc.

Add check at end, will not cost much computing
Unsure how to add tho because already at size limit

Address lookups are currently inefficient/costly

Try different amounts at same time, same amount at time delay, etc. to get more data to see what works and doesn't

Goal - understand how the domain of crypto/arbitrage works

Don't want to rely on solely Jupiter
- Is it possible to pick 2 AMMs and pick a pair (SOL -> USDC and vice versa), do 2 swaps in 1 transaction, and then check the delta at that point

Simple strategy but add atomicity

Look more into the transaction limits and adding atomicity
