**February 27, 2022**:
Its been a while since the last update but heres a summary of the past 1.5 weeks:
- we created a chainlink price monitoring module last week but after meeting with TA/Prof, we decided that wasn't a good route to take
- I continued looking into a way to get good data for prices and after some research I have found coin gecko
https://blog.chain.link/levels-of-data-aggregation-in-chainlink-price-feeds/
- the above link gives a good explanation of how coin gecko and chainlink differ
- I will discuss this with the professor/ta tomorrow in class, but from my research I think some data aggregation is necessary (coin gecko) but not too much (chainlink)
- I have created a small program that returns the values of some prices of MANGO, ORCA, and RAYDIUM against USD using the coin gecko API that I plan to demo in class tomorrow for the TA/Prof
- hopefully this is a promising first start to the price monitoring module
  - (we will find out tomorrow)
