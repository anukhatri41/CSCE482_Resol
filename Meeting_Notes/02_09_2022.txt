Meeting Notes - 02/09/2021

Starting doing the Paper Wallet/Solana programmatically

All In on Money
- Yes and No
- Probably could tho because of small scale
- There are formulas to determine how much to buy/sell

Change Organization Name
Get domain for name
Host on Heroku for now

First step in MVP
- Either make a transaction or module to monitor the AMMs
- Computer runs the software, multiple threads reading the real-time price data from an onchain program to determine a profit
-- Start with 2 onchain to difference between them
-- 2 exchanges, 1 currency pair

Do more research to understand onchain programs
Look at existing arbitrage products to see how they work, duplicate some function they may provide, will help set a clearer goal for milestone

How do you get price? How do you determine price? Basically with how something compares to another currency/token
See how they calculate prices

May need a better machine/faster internet to get accurate prices

Mango and Radium
